## [2.0.0-rc1](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/compare/v1.2.1...v2.0.0-rc1) (2021-12-17)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* remove `canvas.fxmaster.playVideo`, use
`canvas.specials.playVideo` instead.
* In foundry V9, it's not possible anymore to manipulate
the permissions in `CONST`. For that reason, it was necessary to switch
to using a setting instead. Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to
to migrate from the old way to the new way, so users will have to adapt
their settings to match what they had configured previously.
* A lot of things have been moved around. In particular, the es modules
  * module/controls.js
  * filterEffects/FilterManager.js
  * filterEffects/filtersDB.js
  * specialEffects/specialsDB.js
  * specialEffects/SpecialsLayer.js
  * weatherEffects/weatherDB.js
  * weatherEffects/WeatherLayer.js

  do not exist anymore. Asset files also have been moved.
